description: Build features or fix bugs test-first through the red-green loop of test-driven development (TDD), leaving refactoring to review-and-refactor. Use when the user wants test-first work, mentions TDD or red-green-refactor, or wants integration tests.

# Test-first

TDD is the red → green loop. This skill is the reference that makes that loop produce tests worth keeping: what a good test is, where tests go, the anti-patterns, and the rules of the loop. Every section applies on every cycle: consult them before and during the loop, not after.

**Calls:** `design-modules`, `document`. If a called skill is not installed, tell the user its name and install command, `npx skills@latest add Dyrits/SKILLS --skill=<name>`, then carry out that step from its stated intent and report the step as done without the skill. Without `document`, wait until the user installs it or tells you to proceed: this skill's rules use its terms.

Call the Skill tool with "document" when reading or updating project agreements and work records; its terms (authorized, obligation, lazy, pointer) apply. Derive expected behavior from the authorized agreement and applicable requirements: a task, specifications, or a user-approved batch in working state. Keep unresolved proposals distinct from agreed behavior. An assertion changes only when the agreement changes.

Record unfinished cycles and verification evidence in working state under the shared model. Tests establish only what they exercise; appearance and interaction acceptance may require human judgment. The calling implementation workflow records completed authorized agreements and deliveries in root `CHANGELOG.md` using the shared format.

When exploring the codebase, read `GLOSSARY.md` (if it exists) so test names and interface vocabulary match the project's domain language, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

## What a good test is

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a specification: "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists, and it survives refactors because it doesn't care about internal structure.

See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

## Seams: where tests go

A **seam** is the public boundary you test at: the interface where you observe behavior without reaching inside. Tests live at seams, never against internals.

**Test only at pre-agreed seams.** Before writing any test, write down the seams under test and confirm them with the user. No test is written at an unconfirmed seam. You can't test everything, so agreeing the seams up front is how testing effort lands on the critical paths and complex logic instead of every edge case.

Ask: "What's the public interface, and which seams should we test?"

When the shape of that interface is itself in question (how deep the module is, where the seam belongs, what the interface should expose), call the Skill tool with "design-modules" for the vocabulary. It is the shared source of the module, interface, depth, seam, adapter, leverage and locality terms, and it is a reference to consult, not a session to run.

## Anti-patterns

- **Implementation-coupled**: mocks internal collaborators, tests private methods, or verifies through a side channel (querying the database instead of using the interface). The tell: the test breaks when you refactor but behavior hasn't changed.
- **Tautological**: the assertion recomputes the expected value the way the code does (`expect(add(a, b)).toBe(a + b)`, a snapshot derived by hand the same way, a constant asserted equal to itself), so it passes by construction and can never disagree with the code. Expected values must come from an independent source of truth: a known-good literal, a worked example, the specification.
- **Horizontal slicing**: writing all tests first, then all implementation. Bulk tests verify _imagined_ behavior: you test the _shape_ of things rather than user-facing behavior, the tests go insensitive to real changes, and you commit to test structure before understanding the implementation. Work in **vertical slices** instead: one test → one implementation → repeat, each test a **tracer bullet** that responds to what the last cycle taught you.

## Rules of the loop

- **Red before green.** Write the failing test first, then only enough code to pass it. Don't anticipate future tests or add speculative features.
- **One slice at a time.** One seam, one test, one minimal implementation per cycle.
- **Refactoring is not part of the loop.** It belongs to the review stage (see the `review-and-refactor` skill), not the red → green implementation cycle.
